# niri_toolkit

A growing set of multi-language tools (mostly Python) created to extend [niri](https://niri.mitmaro.ca)â€™s capabilities by filling workflow gaps not yet addressed by stock niri commands.  

This toolkit is somewhat similar in spirit to [nirius](https://git.sr.ht/~tsdh/nirius), but focused entirely on practical tools I personally need and use.

## ðŸ”§ TOOLS

### `niri_move_window.py`

Moves a window by matching either its app ID or window title, then targets it to a specific workspace or monitor. You can also bring the moved window into focus.

**Usage:**
```bash
niri_move_window.py \
  --match "googlemessages" \
  --target m|w \
  --target_id "HDMI-A-1"|"workspace-name" \
  --focus
```

**Example Workflow:**
- You use a texting app in a workspace called `messaging`.
- You want to pull it to the center monitor to reply, then return it after.

**Commands:**
```bash
# Pull it to the center monitor:
niri_move_window.py --match "googlemessages" --target "m" --target_id "HDMI-A-1" --focus

# Send it back to the workspace:
niri_move_window.py --match "googlemessages" --target "w" --target_id "messaging"
```

### `niri_scratchpad

Moves the currently focused window to a workspace that acts as a scratchpad similar to the sway scratchpad. Use the --action "put" to put the currently focused window into the workspace you have created to be your scratchpad, for example "scratchpad". Use --action "get" to retrieve the window(s) from your scratchpad workspace. If more than one window exists in the scratchpad workspace a list of windows will be displayed for selection using rofi.

**Usage:**
```bash
niri_scratchpad \
  --acton put|get \
  --scratchpad_name "scratchpad" \
```

**Commands:**
```bash
# Put focused window in a workspace named "my_scratchpad"
niri_scratchpad --action "put" --scratchpad_name "my_scratchpad"

# Retrieve the window(s) from the workspace name "my_scratchpad"
niri_scratchpad --action "get" --scratchpad_name "my_scratchpad"
```

### `niri_tail_event_stream.py`

Connects to the niri IPC and outputs event messages to the console â€” similar to `niri msg event-stream`.

Use this to validate your IPC connection or to observe live event data for debugging or extension purposes.

### `niri_screenshot_picker`

Much of the content of these tools has been generated by AI. I have found one of the best ways to communicate with AI about the status of an issue is to dent it a screenshot...which results in a bunch of screenshots. Niri copies the current screenshot to the clipboard with the option to write it to a file. I've found having a record of the screenshots or going back just a few screenshots to be important to my workflow.

`niri_screenshot_picker` display a grid of the screenshots in your screenshot dir in descending order using feh. `niri_screenshot_picker` calls `niri_screenshot_select` with the parm of the image and whether you want a prompt to copy the image to the clipboard and return to the thumbnail grid. If you don't pass the "noprompt" parm after selecting the screenshot you will be presented with an option to copy it to the clipboard or return to the grid. If "noprompt" is passed the image will be copied to the clipboard and the image window and thumbnail grid will close. The known issue running feh under wayland is that the keystrokes don't work as advertised. So the workflow is to use your mouse to hover over the image and press enter which will display the image in full resolution. When pressing "q" you will be given the option to copy the image to the clipboard, exit or return to the thumbnail grid. When selecting the option to exit, niri msg action close-window will close the thumbnail window.

**Usage:**
```bash
`niri_screenshot_picker`

### `niri-hot-change`

This is a simple popup window that allows you to change the focus-ring section of the config.kdl. You can change the settings and it will write the config.kdl so you can see the results immediately. I gave ChatGPT and Grok the same instructions for the app. ChatGPT was never able to get a fully functioning app and after 8 hours of wrangling with ChatGPT and handcoding we had something that would work but did not prepopulate the values from the config.kdl. Grok to 6 minutes and the app worked perfectly with on the first shot. Also, the code that Grok wrote was significanly better.

`niri-hot-change` 

**Usage:**
```bash
`niri-hot-change`
