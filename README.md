# niri_toolkit

niri_toolkit is a set of multi-language (mostly python) tools generated by AI to add niri commands not yet surfaced through niri stock commands. This has some similarities to nirius (https://git.sr.ht/~tsdh/nirius). These commands are created to fill gaps in my workflow so will be added sporadically.

* niri_move_window.py - this function moves a window by app_id or title to a workspace or monitor and optonally adds focus:
  * niri_move_window.py --match (app_id or title) --target (m = monitor, w = workspace), target_id (monitor or workspace name) --focus "if you want the move window focused"
  * workflow example: I have a texting app in my "messaging" workspace. I want the app focused on my center monitor to respond or create a new text. After completion I want to send the app back to messaging.
  * Retrieve the app: niri_move_window.py --match "googlemessages" --target "m" --target_id "HDMI-A1" --focus
  * Send the app: niri_move_window.py --match "googlemessaging" --target "w" --target_id "messaging"

* niri_tail_event_stream.py - this function connect to niri ipc and sends event messages to the console. Bascially the same functionality as niri msg event-stream. Use this to validate that you are connecting to niri ipc socket if you want to create additional functionality.
